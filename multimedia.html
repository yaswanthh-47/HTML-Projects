      and settle old scores.Set against the violent backdrop of organised crime,
      OG’s return sparks a fierce rivalry with Omi Bhau (played by Emraan Hashmi
      in his Telugu debut), a ruthless antagonist threatening the city’s
      criminal balance. OG must navigate betrayals, violent confrontations, and
      a network of rival gangs while confronting his own past. Along the way,
      the story touches on themes of loyalty, revenge, power struggles, and
      redemption as OG fights to reclaim his place in the underworld.
